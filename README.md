## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Rate Limiting
```python
# Adjust delay between requests (in seconds)
scraper = NBASalaryScraper(delay=3.0)  # 3 second delay
```

### Season Selection
```python
# Get salary data for specific season
salaries_2024 = scraper.get_all_player_salaries('2024')
salaries_2025 = scraper.get_all_player_salaries('2025')
```

## üîç Advanced Usage Examples

### Team Payroll Analysis
```python
# Compare team payrolls
team_summaries = scraper.get_team_salary_summary()
highest_payroll = team_summaries.iloc[0]
print(f"Highest payroll: {highest_payroll['team_name']} - ${highest_payroll['total_payroll']:,.0f}")

# Find teams with most players over $20M
big_contracts = team_summaries.sort_values('players_over_20m', ascending=False)
print("Teams with most $20M+ players:")
print(big_contracts[['team_name', 'players_over_20m']].head())
```

### Player Salary Analysis
```python
# Find all players earning over $40M
all_salaries = scraper.get_all_player_salaries()
supermaxes = all_salaries[all_salaries['2025_salary'] > 40_000_000]
print(f"Players earning over $40M: {len(supermaxes)}")

# Average salary by team
team_avg_salaries = all_salaries.groupby('team_name')['2025_salary'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
print("Teams by average salary:")
print(team_avg_salaries.head())
```

### Export Team-Specific Data
```python
# Export data for specific teams
teams_of_interest = ['LAL', 'GSW', 'BOS', 'MIA']
for team in teams_of_interest:
    team_data = scraper.get_team_payroll(team)
    scraper.export_salary_data(team_data, f'{team}_salaries.csv')
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Rate Limiting & Ethics
- **Built-in delays**: 2-second default delay between requests
- **Respect robots.txt**: Always check website policies
- **Don't overload servers**: Use reasonable delays
- **Cache results**: Store data locally to minimize requests

### Data Accuracy
- Salary data is scraped from public websites
- Contract details may change frequently during season
- Always verify critical information from official sources
- Some contract details (incentives, options) may not be captured

### Legal Considerations
- **Personal use only**: This scraper is for educational purposes
- **Respect terms of service**: Don't violate website policies  
- **No commercial use**: Don't use scraped data commercially without permission
- **Official APIs**: Consider using official NBA APIs when available

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Empty DataFrames**
```python
# Check if data was scraped successfully
if all_salaries.empty:
    print("No salary data found - check website structure or increase delay")
```

**2. Rate Limiting**
```python
# Increase delay if getting blocked
scraper = NBASalaryScraper(delay=5.0)  # 5 second delay
```

**3. Team Not Found**
```python
# Check valid team abbreviations
print(scraper.team_mapping.keys())
```

**4. Export Errors**
```python
# Ensure output directory exists
import os
os.makedirs('output', exist_ok=True)
```

### Debug Mode
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## üìä Sample Analysis Scripts

### Payroll Inequality Analysis
```python
team_summaries = scraper.get_team_salary_summary()
payroll_range = team_summaries['total_payroll'].max() - team_summaries['total_payroll'].min()
print(f"Payroll inequality: ${payroll_range:,.0f} difference between highest and lowest")
```

### Contract Length Analysis
```python
all_salaries = scraper.get_all_player_salaries()
# Calculate average contract length based on guaranteed money vs annual salary
all_salaries['est_contract_years'] = all_salaries['total_guaranteed'] / all_salaries['2025_salary']
avg_contract_length = all_salaries['est_contract_years'].mean()
print(f"Average estimated contract length: {avg_contract_length:.1f} years")
```
